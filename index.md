## Hello, My name is Xyleen I'm here to share some basic information and interesting things about me! 

*YOROSHIKU ONEGAISHIMASU*



#### Currently stationed in Iwakuni, Japan

My husband and I have been in Iwakuni since 2016 and this is our second duty station.
He works for [UNITED STATES NAVY](https://www.navy.mil) that gives us the oppurtunity to be here.  
So far we have been enjoying our time, I love their food, culture and just exploring the beautiful country. 
Lastly, my favorite part about Japan is their spring season, where you can witness their beautiful sakura flower that can only last a week.

#### I was Born in the Philippines

Being station in Japan I was able to visit my birth place and see my family and friends who i haven't seen for a long time.
It was a very emotional feeling! 
Also, everytime I visit I tend to explore the Island, and my favorite so far was when we went to boracay. 
It was an amazing experience!

*the picture below shows no justice how beautiful Boracay is!*
