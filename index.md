#### Currently stationed in Iwakuni, Japan

 + My husband and I have been in Iwakuni since 2016 and this is our second duty station.
He works for [UNITED STATES NAVY](https://www.navy.mil) that gaves us the oppurtunity to live in Japan.  
So far we have been enjoying our time, We love their food, culture and just exploring the beautiful country. 
Lastly, my favorite part about living here is witnessing their beautiful sakura bloosoming beautifully every Spring.

#### I was born in the Philippines

+ Because Japan is close to the Philippines I was able to visit my birth place and see my family and friends who i haven't seen for a long time.
It was a very emotional feeling! 
Also, everytime I visit I tend to explore the Island, and my favorite so far was when we went to boracay. 
It was an amazing experience!
